# Helpful Goose

A Helpful Goose that friends and coworkers can control on your screen to stay engaged and point to things.

Great for Pair Programming and Mentoring type situations. This project has two primary objectives:

1. To allow a remote collaborator to have a cursor that can point at things on the sharing party's screen, without the ability to make any changes to the sharing party's system.
2. To help a remote collaborator stay more engaged with the task on the remote screen with a gamepad in hand to be able to control a graphical cursor, which really helps people who need a tactile/hands-on and interactive interface to stay focused.
